1. Merges the training and test sets to create just one data set. All of this files are in txt format.

2. Reads the features.txt file and extracts only two mesaures: mean and std giving a data frame with dimension 10229x66.

3. Reads the activity_labels.txt file and transform the variables to make them more easy to work with by removing "_" or capital 
    letters.

  3.1 The new names of the activities are like these:
      walking, wlakingupstairs,walkingdownstairs, and so on.

4. It also merges the the data set created in point (1) and the activity labels and the subject ID, and the result is saved in the current 
  working directory as a text file using the write.table command.

5. Just like point (4) the script creates a new data set with the average of each variable (for each activity and subject). This data set 
is also saved as "data_average.txt" in the current working directory. This data set has 180 rows since there are 30 subjects and 6 
activities.
